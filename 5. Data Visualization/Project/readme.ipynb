    "**Ford GoBike** System, now known as [**Bay Wheels**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Wheels) is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area. The operation first begane in August 2013 as **Bay Area Bike Share**, then re-launched as **Ford GoBike** in June 2017 in partnership with Ford Motor Company. In June 2019, after the operatior Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system is renamed to **Bay Wheels**.\n",
